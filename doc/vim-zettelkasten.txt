======================================================
Introduction                        *ztl-introduction*

Vim Zettelkasten aims to allow the use of the
zettelkasten method inside of vim. This plugin is
willing to be as minimalistic as possible to avoid
unecessary noises.

!!! This plugin is mainly vim/vimscript learning 
purpose, take the time to read through scripts and make
sure you agree with how i built them before installing
and use this plugin. I use it on a daily basis though,
but even that can't prevent every possible bugs.

To use it, the easiest way is to use pathogen, thanks
to Tim Pope. Then install clone this from the repo
inside your bundle folder.

======================================================
Syntax                                    *ztl-syntax*

The first thing you'll notice is the syntax.

Here are syntax that are covered.

a_<ANY_ID> and @a_<ANY_ID> : this represents any 
notes that are in your archive.

r_<ANY_ID> and @r_<ANY_ID : this represents any
notes that are in your references, there you can
put your references, links, etc...

@ means a link to original notes. So @r_17 links to 
a notes that contains r_17. If you use ctags and press
the following keystrokes CTRL-] you'll be redirected 
to the note that contains r_17. This is made possible
because of the .ctags file at the root of zettelkasten
folder.

--- --- are region that are highlighted and use as 
metadata. 
e.g

---
  ID: r_7
  Title: The role of banks in our economy
---

References : This word is highlighted because i use
it at the bottom of each file to represent further link
to continue a zettel or link to references.

======================================================
Features                                *ztl-features*

Some new features are here, and some others are yet to
come. 
There are, for now, no way to remap the default mapping
but i'll add some later.

[NEW]
Search through your archive
  current mapping : ,zfz

Search through your tags
  current mapping : ,zft

Add metadata header
  current mapping : ,zh

Add date time	     
  current mapping : ,zt

Add reference section 
  current mapping : ,zr

======================================================
FileType                               *ztl-file-type*

As i said above, every file should end with ".ztl"
extension, otherwise the plugin will not work 
correctly


======================================================
A Sample Project                          *ztl-sample*

There is a sample folder at the root of this project, 
which is not part of the code vim need for this plugin,
that i you can copy in another location. It contains 
three folder that i personally use for my own 
zettelkasten. Inside this folder are some sample .ztl
files. No matter your project structure you will need 
to create files that ends with the extension ".ztl". 

======================================================
Plugin Options	                          *ztl-sample*

The plugin now accepts some customization, and will
enable even more later.

For now the customization is about your slipbox folder
path.

  let g:ztl_default_slipbox_location = 'slipbox'

The path should respect the way you would use it as a
shell command, as it is being used with grep.

  let g:ztl_default_slipbox_location = './archive'
